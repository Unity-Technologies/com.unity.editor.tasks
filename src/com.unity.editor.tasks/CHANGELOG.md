The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [VERSION] - DATE

- Bump version to 2.1.x (no other changes)

## [1.2.32] - 2020-02-12

- Tasks with UI affinity are now invoked faster.
- Make ProcessManager methods virtual so functionality can be reused

## [1.2.18] - 2019-12-17

- Bump .net reference assembly version.
- Add helper for a completed ITask<T> instance

## [1.2.17] - 2019-12-17

- Fix bug in BaseOutputProcess default string processing

## [1.2.16] - 2019-12-17

- Add process tasks that return lists of data
- Moving CancellationToken arg to the end of all ctors
- Restoring some functionality to the base output processor
- Add IsChainExclusive helper method

## [1.2.12] - 2019-12-16

- Stop Unity complaining about namespace changing with defines
- Renaming nuget packages to match the packman naming.

## [1.2.10] - 2019-12-12

- Fix url in package.json

## [1.2.9] - 2019-12-12

- Throw real exception when rethrowing aggregate exceptions
- TaskData is a useful stub class for handling progress reporting, make it public
- TaskManager.UIScheduler is no longer settable. If you want to use a custom UI scheduler, use a custom synchronization context. If you need a custom single-threaded synchronization context, use the `ThreadSynchronizationContext` class.

## [1.2.8] - 2019-12-11

- Harden cancelling and disposing schedulers

## [1.2.7] - 2019-12-10

- Add a threadlocal static field with the current task in TaskBase.
- Add support for running tasks on custom schedulers
- Harden disposing of resources
- Add Native/DotNet/Mono ProcessTask classes to simplify running processes.
- Fix potential type collisions. Add a test to show how to insert tasks in a chain.

## [1.2.1] - 2019-12-05

- Refactor task extension methods to be easier to use. Add .net/mono process tasks

`Then` and `ThenInUI` now take delegates that either have just the data, or success+exception+data, so
it's easier to chain tasks without having to ignore arguments. Since `Then` methods by default only run the
task if the previous one succeeded, there's no reason to make the `success` argument mandatory (it will mostly
always be true).

Also add `ThenInExclusive` extension methods, because `Then` methods by default run in the Concurrent scheduler,
so it makes sense to have a method for the exclusive one, given that there's already one for the UI scheduler.

This also adds `TaskManager.With` extension methods that return `ITask` instances in the same way as `Then` methods.
This makes it easy to create tasks without invoking the constructors explicitely, with the syntax
`TaskManager.With(DoSomething).Then(DoSomethingElse)`.

Extension methods that wrap async/await tasks (TPLTask objects) are now called `ThenAsync`, to make sure
they don't get confused with with overloads that create `Func<T>` tasks.

## [1.2.0] - 2019-12-04

## [1.1.4] - 2019-11-20

- Fix native async/await support

### This is the first release of *Unity Package Unity Editor Tasks*.

Unity Editor Tasks is a [TPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl) based threading package that simplifies running asynchronous code with explicit thread and scheduler settings.
