// A pair of schedulers that together support concurrent (reader) / exclusive (writer)
// task scheduling.  Using just the exclusive scheduler can be used to simulate a serial
// processing queue, and using just the concurrent scheduler with a specified
// MaximumConcurrentlyLevel can be used to achieve a MaxDegreeOfParallelism across
// a bunch of tasks, parallel loops, dataflow blocks, etc.

			// Design:
			//
			// SingleProducerSingleConsumerQueue (SPSCQueue) is a concurrent queue designed to be used
			// by one producer thread and one consumer thread. SPSCQueue does not work correctly when used by
			// multiple producer threads concurrently or multiple consumer threads concurrently.
			//
			// SPSCQueue is based on segments that behave like circular buffers. Each circular buffer is represented
			// as an array with two indexes: m_first and m_last. m_first is the index of the array slot for the consumer
			// to read next, and m_last is the slot for the producer to write next. The circular buffer is empty when
			// (m_first == m_last), and full when ((m_last+1) % m_array.Length == m_first).
			//
			// Since m_first is only ever modified by the consumer thread and m_last by the producer, the two indices can
			// be updated without interlocked operations. As long as the queue size fits inside a single circular buffer,
			// enqueues and dequeues simply advance the corresponding indices around the circular buffer. If an enqueue finds
			// that there is no room in the existing buffer, however, a new circular buffer is allocated that is twice as big
			// as the old buffer. From then on, the producer will insert values into the new buffer. The consumer will first
			// empty out the old buffer and only then follow the producer into the new (larger) buffer.
			//
			// As described above, the enqueue operation on the fast path only modifies the m_first field of the current segment.
			// However, it also needs to read m_last in order to verify that there is room in the current segment. Similarly, the
			// dequeue operation on the fast path only needs to modify m_last, but also needs to read m_first to verify that the
			// queue is non-empty. This results in true cache line sharing between the producer and the consumer.
			//
			// The cache line sharing issue can be mitigating by having a possibly stale copy of m_first that is owned by the producer,
			// and a possibly stale copy of m_last that is owned by the consumer. So, the consumer state is described using
			// (m_first, m_lastCopy) and the producer state using (m_firstCopy, m_last). The consumer state is separated from
			// the producer state by padding, which allows fast-path enqueues and dequeues from hitting shared cache lines.
			// m_lastCopy is the consumer's copy of m_last. Whenever the consumer can tell that there is room in the buffer
			// simply by observing m_lastCopy, the consumer thread does not need to read m_last and thus encounter a cache miss. Only
			// when the buffer appears to be empty will the consumer refresh m_lastCopy from m_last. m_firstCopy is used by the producer
			// in the same way to avoid reading m_first on the hot path.
